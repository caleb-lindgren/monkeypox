# Lineage classification, alignments, and trees

Using [Nextclade](https://clades.nextstrain.org/)

# Installing NextClade

I used the CLI installation code from their platform specific instructions [here](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/stable/user/nextclade-cli.html#download-from-command-line) 

then I wanted to add nextclade to my PATH so I ran this line
```
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)
```
